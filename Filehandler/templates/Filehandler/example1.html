		<p>Hey, welcome to the portal.<br>
		A user can upload a <b>csv file with the below expectations</b> here; which would be processed by python code and its entries would be saved to a database<br> 
		The csv file needs to have <b>36 columns</b> which are Employee Id, First Name Middle etc etc. 
		<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jpE5_INQxXP7cvUFS4Bw_h171D-Xp1xV/view?usp=sharing">Download a Sample file here.</a><br>
		An API GET Endpoint is added to the project so that the user can have a clear picture on how much of the data is entered<br>
		<br>
		<b>http://localhost:8000/example1/Jasir1</b><br>

		This process is then monitered by a task manager, TaskInitiator which is a unique field will be your key to control your tasks.
		<br>
		<br>
		Sample Get Endpoint to Employee entries would look like<br> examples:-<br>
		<b>http://localhost:8000/example1/Jasir1/</b><br>
		here Jasir1 is the TaskInitiator added while uploading the file
		<br>
		Sample Patch Endpoint to pause or terminate a process would be<br>
		<b>http://localhost:8000/update/Jasir</b><br>
		This would show what Task it is operating on and its current status. Here at the Portal the value of status can be written to <b>'Pause' or 'Terminate'</b><br><br>like <br>
		{<br>
    		"status": "running"<br>
		}<br>
		
		please use <b> 'Pause' or 'Terminate' </b> to drive the processes. Otherwise the function autocorrects back to running. 
		
		<b>Please check at the Get Endpoint to see if the process has stopped.</b><br>
		You can resume your task by going to <br>
		http://localhost:8000/resume/Jasir1<br>
		You can delete your task by going to <br>
		http://localhost:8000/delete/Jasir1<br>
		</p>
